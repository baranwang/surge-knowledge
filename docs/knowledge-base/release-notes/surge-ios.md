### 

[](#version-5.11.0)

Version 5.11.0

### 

[](#smart-group)

Smart Group

This is a new type of policy group, driven by our carefully designed algorithm engine, which can automatically select the appropriate policy from the sub-policies of this policy group. The goal of the Smart policy group is to replace the original automatic testing groups (url/load-balance/fallback), greatly optimizing the experience while minimizing the need for manual intervention in policy groups. Users only need to put the available policies into this group.

For details, see: https://kb.nssurge.com/surge-knowledge-base/guidelines/smart-group

### 

[](#rule-system)

Rule System

*   Overall performance optimization of the rule system.
    
*   Significant optimization of the indexing algorithm in large domain rule sets, improving the search efficiency by more than ten times for rule sets with more than 100,000 rules.
    
*   Corrected the issue where sub-rules of logical rules within a rule set could not be covered by the `no-resolve` and `extended-matching` parameters of the rule set.
    
*   Added a new rule type `DOMAIN-WILDCARD`, supporting `?` and `*` domain name matching.
    
*   `DOMAIN-SET` and `RULE-SET` are changed to strict validation. If there are invalid lines in the file, the entire rule set will be invalidated to avoid problems caused by misuse.
    

### 

[](#ipv6)

IPv6

*   The behavior of the `ipv6-vif` parameter has been modified. When set to always, IPv6 functionality will be enabled even if `ipv6=true` is not set.
    
*   Added a warning for the `ipv6-vif=always` parameter.
    
*   Adjusted the automatic retry mechanism. Accessing IPv6 addresses in a non-IPv6 network will no longer enter the retry process, and the request will fail immediately (solving the problem of some applications stalling when IPv6 VIF is enabled in a non-IPv6 environment, but the application will still continue to send IPv6 requests).
    

### 

[](#other-optimizations)

Other Optimizations

*   Enhanced `$notification.post`, adding support for media resources, sound hints, and automatic dismissal.
    
*   Optimized WireGuard failure handling.
    
*   Reduced the power consumption of the TUIC protocol during sleep.
    
*   Improved the precision of time statistics in the request log system, now accurate to Âµs level.
    
*   Optimized various abnormal retry mechanisms, avoiding high resource usage caused by continuous retry in the face of some specific problems. For operations that need to be retried continuously (such as WireGuard reconnection, Ponte server reporting to iCloud), Surge will now retry after 0.1s, 0.5s, 1s, 5s, 10s, 30s after an error.
    
*   Optimized the caching system for external resources.
    
*   Added the profile line modifier `#!REQUIREMENT`.
    
*   When the current network is found to be managed by Surge Mac Gateway, Surge iOS will now automatically pause. (This can be adjusted via the auto-suspend option, enabled by default.)
    
*   Optimized TUN takeover and specific app performance compatibility issues.
    
*   Optimized memory usage, infrequently used and large scripts will not be cached in memory anymore.
    
*   The network diagnostics page adds SSID/BSSID with copy functionality.
    
*   Now, when uploading logs in the log interface, the engine currently running will automatically generate the most recent verbose logs (the new version has cached 256KB of logs in memory), so when reporting problems, you can upload directly without needing to reproduce in verbose mode.
    
*   For external resources related to policy groups and script types, the maximum size is now limited to 2MB, to avoid memory overflow in case of configuration errors.
    

### 

[](#detail-adjustments)

Detail Adjustments

*   Raised the memory warning threshold to 45MB, previously 40MB.
    
*   Limited the length of logs that can be written to request notes in debug mode by scripts.
    
*   Changed the default UDP test target to 1.0.0.1.
    
*   If incorrect types of fields are passed when using API in scripts, it will result in script errors.
    
*   After the script is completed or times out, unfinished $httpClient will no longer call the callback function.
    

### 

[](#issue-fixes)

Issue Fixes

*   Fixed the issue where changes in iCloud content might not be detected by the main program when both Surge iOS main program and engine are enabled.
    
*   Fixed the problem where Header Rewrite rules could not match URLs based on the Host field.
    
*   Corrected the issue where ip-version and tos parameters could not take effect when testing proxies.
    
*   Fixed the crash issue caused by mistakenly passing null when executing scripts via HTTP-API.
    

### 

[](#version-5.10.0)

Version 5.10.0

#### 

[](#new-features-1)

New Features

*   New subscription feature: Body Rewrite. Surge now can rewrite the body of HTTP request or response, replacing the original content with regular expressions. If you need to make more flexible modifications, try scripting.
    

#### 

[](#improvements-1)

Improvements

*   Comprehensive enhancement of the Mock (Map Local) function, adding data types such as text, tiny-gif, base64 to facilitate inline data return. Also added the ability to customize status codes.
    
*   Optimized the request list filter, now displaying the filter at the top and allowing quick toggling of filter activation. Long-pressing a filter item displays a menu for deletion or reversing the item to a negative filter.
    
*   Added recognition for STUN packets, which can be matched with PROTOCOL,STUN.
    
*   Optimized the external resource management page.
    
*   Optimized the script editor page.
    
*   Optimized the module management page.

### 

[](#version-5.8.1)

Version 5.8.1

#### 

[](#rule-engine-optimizations)

Rule Engine Optimizations

*   The implementation of RULE-SET and DOMAIN-SET has been completely rewritten. Now, Surge automatically preprocesses and indexes rule sets during resource updates, significantly increasing the matching speed.
    
    1.  There is no longer any difference in performance and memory usage between RULE-SET and DOMAIN-SET types of rule sets, allowing flexible usage.
        
    2.  There is no longer a restriction in DOMAIN-SET rule sets that prevents the use of eTLDs.
        
    3.  The matching speed for DOMAIN, DOMAIN-SUFFIX, IP-CIDR, and IP-CIDR6 rules in RULE-SET has been greatly improved.
        
    4.  A DOMAIN/DOMAIN-SUFFIX rule set with approximately 100,000 entries used to take 100ms for a single match in the old version; now, it only takes single-digit ms.
        
    5.  An IP-CIDR rule set with approximately 10,000 entries used to take about 0.1ms for a single match in the old version. The new version only needs 0.0002ms, an improvement of about 500 times. The performance improvement for IP-CIDR6 rules is even greater.
        
    6.  In the new version, building a regional IP address collection using the IP-CIDR rule set offers the same performance as directly using the internal GEOIP rule.
        
    7.  The Inline Ruleset added in the previous version does not benefit from this optimization, but there is virtually no difference at the scale of hundreds of entries.
        
    8.  In previous versions, rules within a Ruleset were matched one by one from top to bottom. If rules requiring DNS resolution were included, DNS would only be triggered when starting to match that sub-rule. In the new version, if any rule requiring DNS resolution is included in the rule set, DNS resolution will occur before testing that rule set. (In most cases, there is no difference)
        
    
*   Main ruleset matching efficiency has been slightly optimized.
    
*   The efficiency of IP-CIDR6 rules has been significantly improved even in non-indexed situations.
    
*   RULE-SET rules can now be configured directly with parameters no-resolve and extended-matching, which are equivalent to configuring all sub-rules with these parameters.
    
*   DOMAIN-SET rule sets also support configuration with extended-matching.
    

#### 

[](#minor-optimizations)

Minor Optimizations

*   Now, when performing MITM, the certificate used for signing will be sent to the client together, to support using intermediate certificates for MITM.
    
*   All comments (at the beginning and end of lines) can now use `#`, `//`, `;` three common comment symbols.
    
*   Profile error message prompt optimization, now it can give the exact line number where the error occurred more accurately.
    
*   Fixed an issue that BSSID related matching rules might fail.
    
*   Optimize Surge Ponte error handling process, correct the issue where device information is not automatically updated under certain errors.
    
*   Bug fixes.
    

### 

[](#version-5.8.0)

Version 5.8.0

#### 

[](#new-features-2)

New Features

*   New Inky icon
    
*   Protocol sniffing
    
    Requests to port 80 and 443 will wait for the client to send the first packet, then extract the SNI and other information for the rule system to judge.
    
    *   `DOMAIN`, `DOMAIN-SUFFIX`, `DOMAIN-KEYWORD` rules add an optional parameter called `extended-matching`. When this parameter is enabled, the rule will try to match both the SNI and the HTTP Host Header (or :authority).
        
    *   Added a parameter called `always-raw-tcp-hosts`, used to forcibly turn off active protocol detection for specific hostnames.
        
    
*   New proxy protocol support: Hysteria 2
    
    Hysteria 2 is a proxy protocol optimized for unstable and packet-loss-prone network environments, based on UDP/QUIC.
    
*   Automatic QUIC blocking
    
    Since most proxy protocols are not suitable for forwarding QUIC traffic, Surge will now automatically block QUIC traffic to make it fallback to HTTPS/TCP protocol, ensuring performance. For QUIC traffic that hits the MITM hostname, it will also be automatically rejected.
    
*   ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) support for QUIC-based protocols
    
    Significantly improved the performance of the Vector(Surge Ponte)/TUIC/Hysteria 2 protocol.
    

#### 

[](#optimizations-1)

Optimizations

*   Reworked HTTP capture functionality
    
    *   The related settings are no longer stored in the configuration, the `[Replica]` section has been deprecated.
        
    *   Added an automatic shut-off setting after turning on the capture switch, which can automatically stop capturing based on time, size, or the number of requests.
        
    *   Added automatic activation of MITM after turning on the capture switch, which can be additionally turned on for specific hostnames. (Even if the main MITM switch is off).
        
    *   Added an option to only save HTTP/HTTPS requests after turning on the capture switch.
        
    
*   VIF performance optimization, tested to achieve full speed of a 2.5Gbps wired network card on iPhone 15 Pro with VIF taking over a single thread. (Proxy mode performs even better)
    
*   Wi-Fi Assist and Hybrid features will only take effect after the device is unlocked, to avoid unnecessary power and data consumption.
    
*   From this version on, the size of external resources is limited to no more than 10MB to prevent excessive memory usage caused by abnormal external resources. (Except for `domain-set`)
    
*   The parameters `udp-policy-not-supported-behaviour`, `include-apns`, `include-cellular-services` have been added to the UI settings.
    
*   Improved compatibility with some non-standard protocols.
    
*   When testing the Ponte policy, the test URL has been changed from `proxy-test-url` to `internet-test-url`.
    
*   Following the WireGuard protocol standard recommendation, WireGuard handshake packets will now be tagged with 0x88 (AF41) DSCP to increase the success rate.
    
*   When forwarding UDP packets via WireGuard, it supports retaining the TOS(DSCP/ECN) tag of packets inside the tunnel.
    
*   Based on the WireGuard protocol standard recommendation, Surge will copy the ECN tag from packets inside the tunnel to packets outside. When receiving packets with an ECN tag, they will be strictly merged according to RFC6040. (`ecn=true` must be set for the policy).
    
*   UDP NAT can close the UDP session early based on ICMP messages.
    
*   Improved PMTU support for QUIC.
    

#### 

[](#bug-fixes-1)

Bug Fixes

*   Fixed the issue where the external resources of rule sets needed to be reloaded to take effect after updates.
    
*   After a network switch, it will forcefully break the original long connection of DoH/DoQ/DoH3 to avoid obtaining results that are not suitable for the current network environment.
    
*   Fixed the issue where invalid certificates might cause the key store interface to crash.
    
*   Fixed the issue where the Ponte device option in the policy group page might not display text.
    
*   When performing MITM on HTTPS requests that directly connect using an IP address, the IP address should not be sent as SNI, as this might cause compatibility issues.
    
*   Other bug fixes.

[](#policy-group-1)

Policy Group

In this release, we completely refactored the policy group functionality, bringing the following changes:

1.  The url-test/fallback/load-balance policy group can no longer be configured with a specific testing URL but with a global testing URL or a policy-configured testing URL. The policy's test results can be used directly in all policy group decisions, eliminating the need to retest each policy group individually.
    
2.  All types of policy groups support mixed nesting. The only requirement is that no circular references can be used.
    
3.  When a group policy is used as a sub-policy of the url-test/fallback/load-balance group.
    

*   The latency of the select/url-test/fallback/ssid group is the latency of the selected policy.
    
*   The latency of the load-balance group is the average of the latencies of all available policies.
    

1.  The timeout parameter of a policy group marks policies with latency exceeding this parameter as unavailable when making decisions for the group. But the maximum time taken to test the policy group is controlled by the global test-timeout parameter. (Default is 5s)
    
2.  When testing a group due to decision making, all sub-policies that the group may use are tested, including sub-policies of the sub-policy group.
    
3.  You may use no-alert=true parameter to suppress notifications for particular groups.

*   Surge will try to set up a connection with cellular data when the Wi-Fi network is poor.
    

Changes in DNS-over-HTTPS

*   From this version, if DNS-over-HTTPS is configured, the traditional DNS will only be used to test the connectivity and resolve the domain in the DOH URL.

[](#version-4.2.0-apr-17-2020)

Version 4.2.0 (Apr 17, 2020)

New Feature: Module Module is a set of settings to override the current profile. You may use modules to:

*   Tweak settings in a non-editable profile, such as managed profile and enterprise profile.
    
*   Change part of settings with one tap. For example, you may use a module to enable MitM for all hostnames and adjust the filter temporarily.
    
*   Use a module written by others to accomplish a particular task. For example, your co-work may share with you a module that rewrites the API requests to a test server.
    
*   When you share one profile among devices, some settings might need modifying for different scenarios. The enabling state of modules won't be synced to other devices, so you can use a module to fulfill.
    

Minor Improvements:

*   Added a new rule type: PROTOCOL.
    
*   Improved the MITM CA certificate install assistant.
    
*   You may now use UI to configure a load-balance policy group.
