Why can't I find Surge in the App Store?

*   Surge Mac: Surge Mac uses technology that is not compatible with the Mac App Store, so it cannot be installed from the Mac App Store. Please download and install it from the official website.
    
*   Surge iOS/tvOS: Since the China region bans all VPN-related apps, Surge iOS cannot be listed in the China region, but other regions are not affected.
