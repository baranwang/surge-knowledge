[](#how-do-i-manage-which-devices-are-authorized-and-activated)

How do I manage which devices are authorized and activated?

Each license can freely activate a limited number of devices.

1.  Activated devices can be used without restrictions for life.
    
2.  If the number limit is reached, you need to deactivate the old device before activating the new one. The deactivation operation can only be done on the original device. (Settings › License & Updates › Deactivation)
    
3.  If you cannot operate on the original device (e.g., lost or under repair), you can perform a Reset on the [License Management Page](https://nssurge.com/account) to deactivate all devices under the license and regenerate a new license key. This operation can be performed once every 3 days.

[](#why-does-it-say-my-license-key-is-incorrect)

Why does it say my license key is incorrect?

1.  First, please make sure that your license key is for the corresponding product. A Surge iOS license key cannot be used for Surge Mac.
    
2.  Then, make sure the license version and the software version are consistent. If the versions are inconsistent during activation, you will be prompted.
    
3.  Finally, please note that after performing the Reset operation, the original license key will be invalidated, and a new license key will be sent to your email. If you forget the latest license key, you can visit the [License Management Page](https://nssurge.com/account) to resend it.
    
4.  If you have lost access to the original license email, please fill out this form: [Surge License Retrieve](https://goo.gl/forms/lYmbWMBXrqh0NSPs1)
    
5.  If you have changed the license email, please remember to use the new email for activation.
