Policy
======

Surge can forward requests to another proxy server or connect to the host directly, depending on customized rules. A policy indicates how Surge will deal with the requests.

There are 3 types of policies: [proxy](policy/proxy.html), [policy group](policy/group.md) and [bulit-in policy](policy/built-in.html).
