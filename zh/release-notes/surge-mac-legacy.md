https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v4/Surge-4.10.2-1981-d99d487bbd9f9109a00dd5a5b7915be4.zip

### 

[](#version-4.10.1-dec-3-2022)

Version 4.10.1 (Dec 3, 2022)

#### 

[](#new-feature)

New Feature

*   Gaming Optimization Mode: `udp-priority = true`. Enabling it will prioritize UDP packets when the system load is very high, and packet processing is delayed.
    
*   SOCKS5 proxy now supports UDP forwarding, as the server side does not consistently support UDP forwarding, the parameter udp-relay=true needs to be explicitly configured.
    
*   The `ipv6-vif` parameter now supports `always` and `auto` like Surge iOS. If set to `auto`, IPv6 VIF will only be enabled if a valid Internet IPv6 address (2000::/3) exists.
    

#### 

[](#minor-improvements)

Minor Improvements

*   URL regular expressions for Script, Rewrite, Mock, etc. will try to match URLs constructed in many different ways (e.g. Host field in Header) to solve the problem that some apps use custom DNS logic to request directly to IP addresses.
    
*   Removed the silencing mechanism after UDP forwarding errors to avoid extra waiting time after switching networks.
    
*   The IPv6 switch no longer prevents direct access to IPv6 addresses when turned off. The switch is now limited to controlling whether the DNS Client requests AAAA records.
    
*   Automatic disabling of AAAA queries due to DNS issues will be prompted in the Event Center instead of just in the logs.
    
*   Fixed handling issue of generating IPv6 fragmentation when forwarding IPv6 UDP packets via WireGuard.
    
*   The external policy group will skip the line and continue processing when it encounters invalid content instead of returning an error directly.
    
*   Adjusted the buffering mechanism of raw TCP forwarding to avoid conflicts with some apps.
    
*   Fixed REJECT requests not being marked as failed under MITM H2.
    
*   Adjusted the output text under diagnostics.
    
*   Other bug fixes.

    *   It's a list parameter, using commas as the separator.
        
    *   You may specify a single IP address or use a CIDR block, both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.
        
    *   You may use the `-` prefix to exclude some clients, e.g., `client-source-address = -192.168.1.2, 0.0.0.0/0`
        
    *   If the parameter is not set, MITM is enabled for all clients. A equivalent to `client-source-address = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`
        
    *   `127.0.0.1` should be included if you want to enable MITM for the current device.
        
    

#### 

[](#wireguard)

*   The new parameter include-other-group="group1,group2" is added to include policies from another policy group, and can include multiple policy groups separated by commas, also can be used with the policy-regex-filter parameter for filtering.
    
*   include-all-proxies, include-other-group, and policy-path parameters are allowed to be used in a single policy group at the same time. The policy-regex-filter parameter applies to all three.
    
*   There is an order of precedence among the policy groups for the include-other-group parameter, but there is no order of precedence among the include-all-proxies, include-other-group, and policy-path parameters. For scenarios where the order of sub-policies makes sense (e.g., fallback groups), use policy groups nesting with include-other-group.

[](#version-4.0.5)

Version 4.0.5

#### 

[](#policy-group-1)

Policy Group

In this release, we completely refactored the policy group functionality, bringing the following changes:

1.  The url-test/fallback/load-balance policy group can no longer be configured with a specific testing URL but with a global testing URL or a policy-configured testing URL. The policy's test results can be used directly in all policy group decisions, eliminating the need to retest each policy group individually.
    
2.  All types of policy groups support mixed nesting. The only requirement is that no circular references can be used.
    
3.  When a group policy is used as a sub-policy of the url-test/fallback/load-balance group.
    
    *   The latency of the select/url-test/fallback/ssid group is the latency of the selected policy.
        
    *   The latency of the load-balance group is the average of the latencies of all available policies.
        
    
4.  The timeout parameter of a policy group marks policies with latency exceeding this parameter as unavailable when making decisions for the group. But the maximum time taken to test the policy group is controlled by the global test-timeout parameter. (Default is 5s)
    
5.  When testing a group due to decision making, all sub-policies that the group may use are tested, including sub-policies of the sub-policy group.
    
6.  You may use no-alert=true parameter to suppress notifications for particular groups.

Changes in DNS over HTTPS

*   From this version, if DNS-over-HTTPS is configured, the traditional DNS will only be used to test the connectivity and resolve the domain in the DOH URL.
    
*   The DNS over HTTPS now has a separate parameter: doh-server. The DOH servers in 'dns-server' will be moved to the new parameter after saving.
    
*   The legacy DNS is always required now.
    
*   DOH can be matched with rule 'PROTOCOL,DOH' now.
    
*   Added a new parameter 'doh-follow-outbound-mode'. In the previous version, the DOH client follows the system proxy settings. From this version, all DOH requests will use DIRECT policy by default. If 'doh-follow-outbound-mode' is set, the DOH requests will follow the outbound mode settings regardless of the system proxy settings.
    
*   We are refactoring the HTTP client for DOH and scripting. Please feedback if you encounter any issue.
